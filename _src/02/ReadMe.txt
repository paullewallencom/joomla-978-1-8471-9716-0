CodePack for Chapters 2

This Pack contains 4 "shots" of the development stage of the Chapter 2 template, starting with index01.html and ending with the final: index04.html. 

NOTE: You can skip this stage and work with any basic XHTML/CSS template (so long as you understand the XHTML markup and CSS in the template).

Good resources for free XHTML and CSS templates are:
