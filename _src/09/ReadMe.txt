CodePack for Chapters 8

This Pack contains the final template with jQuery Lightbox installed. Be sure to download the latest version of jQuery Lightbox and jQuery (see the chapter for URLs)

It also contains the SuckerFish dropdown menu from Chapter 7. 

Be sure to reference Chapter 7 and add the appropriate "_sf" suffix to your main menu so your menu styles correctly and any sub-menu dropdowns work.

Please Note the templateDetails.xml file! It's been updated to accommodate the jQuery Lightbox plugin. Be sure to do the same if you apply it to your own template.

This chapter also discusses specific plugins which are not part of the template. Be sure to download the latest version of the plugins discussed in this chapter and follow the author's instructions for installation. (see the chapter for URLs)
